# Positions
positions is a utility to view current positions for crypto portfolios

## Design
As a cypto holder I would like to be able to understand my current position of my crypto holdings. Positions include:
* cost basis per coin
* total cost basis
* quantity of each coin
* % of hodlings - How much of the total portfolio does each coin make up

Improvements / later iterations:
* Current price of asset
* today's gain/loss $ and %
* total gain/loss $ and %

Sample view: 
|asset|% of hodlings|quantity|cost per coin|total cost basis|
|-----|-------------|--------|-------------|----------------|
|forge|5            |10      |$10          |$100            |
|hamme|95           |2       |$950         |$1900           |
